Nate
====
Tiny little fluent state machine for .NET

[![Nuget (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/nate)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/nate)

Full documentation coming soon
------------------------------

Inspired by [Martin Fowler's DSL Book](http://martinfowler.com/dslwip/Intro.html#TheStateMachineFramework), [Ruby's ActsAsStateMachine gem](http://github.com/rubyist/aasm), and Workflow Foundation's bloat.

* Simple, embeddable
  * Does not ask application to conform to its framework.  Just drops into any class to give it simple state machine abilities. 
  * Fast and efficient - Designed to be instantiated statically.  A given StateMachine is itself stateless, and transforms the state of StateModels passed to it.  
  * Keeps the state where it belongs, on the model itself.  Not serialized elsewhere.
  * Provides all the plumbing necessary: states, transitions, triggers, callbacks, machines
* Fluent API
  * Describe your state machine, it's transitions, triggers, callbacks, etc. in a minimal, readable, english-like C# syntax, all without repeating yourself.
  * Fluent API is implemented with a Nate state machine, itself.
* Flexible
  * Support for multiple identical triggers per state with varying targets, chosen from at runtime via lambda expression guards
  * Support for globally-available transitions which provide a pragmatic way to always allow short-circuits
  * Exposure of Underlying State Machine model allows for more advanced possibilities

**An example implementing Martin Fowler's Gothic Security DSL Sample, demonstrating a portion of the Fluent API.**

The state machine is described succinctly and embedded directly within the StateModel, which holds (and probably persists) the current state.  


    public class MissGrantController : IStateModel
    {
        /* state is stored on the model */
        public object CurrentState { get; set; }
        public MissGrantController() { CurrentState = securityControllerStateMachine.InitialState; }

        /* state machine is described once, statically */
        private static IFluentStateMachine<MissGrantController> 
        securityControllerStateMachine = FluentStateMachine<MissGrantController>.Describe()
            .State("idle")
                .AfterEntry(e => {
                    e.Model.UnlockDoor();
                    e.Model.LockPanel(); })
                .TransitionsTo("active").On("doorClosed")
                .Initiates()
            .State("active")
                .TransitionsTo("waitingForLight").On("drawOpened")
                .TransitionsTo("waitingForDraw").On("lightOn")
            .State("waitingForLight")
                .TransitionsTo("unlockedPanel").On("lightOn")
            .State("waitingForDraw")
                .TransitionsTo("unlockedPanel").On("drawOpened")
            .State("unlockedPanel")
                .AfterEntry(e => {
                    e.Model.UnlockPanel();
                    e.Model.LockDoor(); })
                .TransitionsTo("idle").On("panelClosed")
            .GloballyTransitionsTo("idle").On("doorOpened")
            .Compile();

        /* external controls */
        public void DoorClosed() { securityControllerStateMachine.Trigger("doorClosed", this); }
        public void DrawOpened() { securityControllerStateMachine.Trigger("drawOpened", this); }
        public void LightOn() { securityControllerStateMachine.Trigger("lightOn", this); }
        public void DoorOpened() { securityControllerStateMachine.Trigger("doorOpened", this); }
        public void PanelClosed() { securityControllerStateMachine.Trigger("panelClosed", this); }

        /* locking/unlocking actions */
        private void UnlockPanel() { Console.WriteLine("Unlocking Panel"); }
        private void LockPanel() { Console.WriteLine("Locking Panel"); }
        private void LockDoor() { Console.WriteLine("Locking Door"); }
        private void UnlockDoor() { Console.WriteLine("Unlocking Door"); }
    }
